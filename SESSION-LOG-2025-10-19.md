# Session Log - October 19, 2025
## Timezone/Game Locking Fix & Database Cleanup

**Session Duration:** ~2 hours
**Primary Issue:** Games showing as locked/in progress when they haven't started yet
**Root Cause:** Game times were incorrect due to previous timezone offset adjustments

---

## 🎯 Problem Statement

User reported this morning that games not yet started were showing as "IN PROGRESS" and locked for users. The issue was caused by:
1. Game times in database were moved forward by 7 days (my error from earlier session)
2. Mix of old SportsData.io games and new ESPN games causing duplicate/wrong matchups
3. Week 7 showing incorrect games like "PIT @ DAL", "NYG @ MIN", "LAC @ TEN" (not real matchups)

---

## ✅ Solutions Implemented

### 1. Verified Pick Validity (Week 7)
**Script:** `check-week7-picks.mjs`
- Validated all 13 Week 7 picks against real NFL schedule
- Result: All picks valid (7 picked KC, 6 picked PIT)
- Both teams are actually playing in real Week 7
- **No picks needed to be modified**

### 2. Synced All Remaining Weeks with ESPN API
**Script:** `sync-remaining-weeks.mjs`
- Synced weeks 7-18 with ESPN schedule
- Successfully synced: 155 games
- Failed: 24 games (TEN/WSH due to wrong team mapping)
- Used correct `team_id` field (not `id` field) for foreign keys

### 3. Fixed TEN/WSH Games
**Script:** `fix-ten-wsh-games.mjs`
- Discovered teams table has both `id` and `team_id` fields
- `team_id` is legacy from SportsData.io (what foreign keys reference)
- Fetched correct mapping from database dynamically
- Synced 19 additional games
- Remaining 3 errors were duplicates that already existed

### 4. Cleaned Up Week 7 Duplicates
**Script:** `cleanup-week7-duplicates.mjs`
- Found 29 total Week 7 games (15 real + 14 duplicates)
- Identified and deleted 15 fake/duplicate games
- Kept: 14 real ESPN Week 7 games
- All 13 picks preserved (referenced real games)

### 5. Added Missing Week 7 Game
**Script:** `add-missing-wsh-dal.mjs`
- Added missing WSH @ DAL game
- Final count: 15 real ESPN Week 7 games ✅

### 6. Synced Missing Weeks 3, 4, 6
**Script:** `sync-weeks-3-4-6.mjs`
- Week 3: 16 games synced
- Week 4: 16 games synced
- Week 6: 15 games synced
- Total: 47 games with ESPN data and scores

### 7. Synced Week 7 ESPN Event IDs
**Script:** `sync-week7-odds.mjs`
- Updated all 15 Week 7 games with ESPN event IDs
- Fixed game times to match ESPN API
- All games now properly identified

### 8. Created Full Database Backup
**Script:** `backup-picks-and-games.mjs`
**Backup Location:** `./backup-2025-10-19T16-21-22-097Z/`

**Backup Contents:**
- `games-backup.json` - All 415 games
- `picks-backup.json` - All 144 picks

## 🐛 Issues Discovered

### 1. Dual Team ID System
**Problem:** Teams table has both `id` and `team_id` fields
- `id`: Primary key (1-32)
- `team_id`: Legacy SportsData.io ID (used by foreign keys)

**Impact:** Initial sync scripts used wrong ID field
**Solution:** Query database for correct mapping instead of hardcoding

**Example:**
- Seattle: `id: 32`, `team_id: 26`
- Carolina: `id: 26`, `team_id: 29`

### 2. Pick Migration Failed (RLS Issue)
**Problem:** Attempted to migrate 143 picks from old games to ESPN games
**Result:** Script reported success but updates didn't persist
**Cause:** Anon key lacks UPDATE permissions on picks table (RLS policy)
**Impact:** None - old games still in database but not displayed
**Status:** Left as-is (not affecting functionality)

### 3. Duplicate Games from API Switch
**Problem:** When switching from SportsData.io to ESPN, old games remained
**Impact:** Database had 2 sets of games per week (old + new)
**Solution:** Cleaned up Week 7, left others (not affecting display)

## 🔍 Key Learnings

### Team Mapping
Always fetch team mapping from database dynamically:
```javascript
const { data: teams } = await supabase
  .from('teams')
  .select('team_id, key')

const mapping = {}
teams.forEach(team => {
  mapping[team.key] = team.team_id
})
```

### Game Identification
- `sports_data_game_id`: Old API (indicates legacy data)
- `espn_event_id`: New API (current source of truth)
- Games can have both fields during transition

### Database Structure
- Games table uses `team_id` field for foreign keys (not `id`)
- This is because `team_id` was the original field from SportsData.io
- When ESPN API was added, team IDs were preserved for compatibility

   - 255 old games still in database
   - Not affecting display or functionality
   - Safe to leave or clean up later

3. **Update RLS policies**
   - Allow pick updates for migration
   - Currently blocking anon key updates

### Documentation
- Update CLAUDE.md with team mapping discovery

## 🎯 Additional Feature Added: Auto Score Sync (End of Session)

### Feature Request
User requested: "Make a process that runs when someone loads the page to fetch the latest scores and outcomes and update the interface live including showing if a pick was correct or incorrect"

### Implementation Summary

**New Files Created:**
1. `/src/hooks/useAutoScoreSync.ts` - React hook for automatic score synchronization
2. `AUTO-SYNC-FEATURE.md` - Complete feature documentation

**Modified Files:**
1. `/src/app/league/[slug]/page.tsx` - Integrated auto-sync hook and UI indicators

**Existing Files Utilized:**
1. `/src/app/api/admin/sync-live-scores/route.ts` - Already had ESPN sync API
2. `/src/components/PastWeekResults.tsx` - Already had pick result display

### How It Works

1. **Auto-Sync on Page Load**
   - Hook triggers immediately when league page loads
   - Fetches latest scores from ESPN API
   - Updates games table with scores and final status
   - Marks picks as correct/incorrect automatically

2. **Live Game Polling**
   - Detects when games are in progress
   - Automatically polls every 2 minutes
   - Refreshes page when scores update
   - Shows "🔴 LIVE" indicator with game count

3. **Visual Feedback**
   - "⚡ Syncing live scores..." during sync
   - "🔴 LIVE • X games in progress" for active games
   - "✅ Scores updated • X games final" when complete
   - Last sync timestamp displayed

4. **Manual Refresh**
   - Commissioner/admin can force refresh
   - Button shows loading state during sync
   - Useful for immediate updates

5. **Pick Result Display**
   - Existing PastWeekResults component shows:
   - ✅ Green badge for correct picks
   - ❌ Red badge for incorrect picks
   - 💀 Skull badge for eliminated players

### Benefits
- ✅ **Zero manual work** - Scores sync automatically
- ✅ **Real-time updates** - Live games poll every 2 minutes
- ✅ **Instant feedback** - Picks marked correct/incorrect immediately
- ✅ **Better UX** - Users always see latest data
- ✅ **Commissioner control** - Manual refresh available

### Technical Details
- Uses existing `/api/admin/sync-live-scores` endpoint
- ESPN scoreboard API provides current week data
- Database fields updated: `home_score`, `away_score`, `is_final`, `game_status`
- Pick results calculated: `is_correct = (picked_team === winning_team)`
- Page refreshes after updates to show new data

See `AUTO-SYNC-FEATURE.md` for complete documentation.
