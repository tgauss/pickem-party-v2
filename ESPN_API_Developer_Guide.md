## üìä DATA MAPPING FOR SURVIVOR LEAGUE

### Essential Data Fields

#### Game Data
```javascript
{
  gameId: event.id,
  homeTeam: competition.competitors[0].team.abbreviation,
  awayTeam: competition.competitors[1].team.abbreviation, 
  homeScore: competition.competitors[0].score,
  awayScore: competition.competitors[1].score,
  gameDate: event.date,
  week: event.week.number,

## üöÄ IMPLEMENTATION STRATEGY

### Data Collection Schedule
```
Pre-Season Setup:
- Fetch all teams: Once per season
- Fetch season structure: Once per season

Weekly Updates:
- Tuesday: Get week schedule, initial odds
- Wednesday-Saturday: Update injury reports, odds movement  
- Game Day: Live scores every 1-2 minutes
- Post-Game: Final scores, validate picks
```

### Recommended Tech Stack
```
Backend: Python/Node.js with async HTTP client
Database: PostgreSQL for relational data
Cache: Redis for real-time data
Scheduler: Celery/Cron for automated updates
```

### Sample Implementation (Python)
```python
import requests
import asyncio
from datetime import datetime

class ESPNApiClient:
    def __init__(self):
        self.base_urls = {
            'site': 'https://site.api.espn.com',
            'core': 'https://sports.core.api.espn.com',
            'cdn': 'https://cdn.espn.com'
        }
    
    async def get_week_games(self, week, season_type=2):
        url = f"{self.base_urls['site']}/apis/site/v2/sports/football/nfl/scoreboard"
        params = {'week': week, 'seasontype': season_type}
        
        response = requests.get(url, params=params)
        response.raise_for_status()
        return response.json()
    
    async def get_game_odds(self, event_id):
        url = f"{self.base_urls['core']}/v2/sports/football/leagues/nfl/events/{event_id}/competitions/{event_id}/odds"
        
        response = requests.get(url)
        response.raise_for_status()
        return response.json()
```

## ‚ö†Ô∏è ERROR HANDLING & BEST PRACTICES

### HTTP Status Codes
- `200`: Success
- `404`: Game/resource not found  
- `429`: Rate limited (implement backoff)
- `500`: Server error (retry with exponential backoff)

### Defensive Coding
```python
def safe_get_nested(data, path, default=None):
    """Safely get nested dictionary values"""
    try:
        for key in path.split('.'):
            data = data[key]
        return data
    except (KeyError, TypeError, AttributeError):
        return default

# Usage
home_score = safe_get_nested(game, 'competitions.0.competitors.0.score', '0')
```

### Rate Limiting
- Implement 1-2 second delays between requests
- Use connection pooling
- Cache responses when possible

### Data Validation
```python
def validate_game_data(game):
    required_fields = ['id', 'date', 'competitions']
    return all(field in game for field in required_fields)
```
