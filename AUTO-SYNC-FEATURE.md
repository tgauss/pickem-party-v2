## 🔄 Automatic Refresh Logic

### Initial Load
- Syncs immediately when page loads
- Shows loading indicator

### Live Game Polling
- If `liveGames > 0`, sets up 2-minute interval
- Automatically clears interval when no live games
- Prevents multiple concurrent syncs

### Page Refresh After Updates
- If `updatedGames > 0`, refreshes page after 1 second
- Ensures users see latest data
- Smooth transition with brief delay

---

## 🔐 Permissions

### Manual Refresh Button

---

## 📝 Database Updates

### Games Table
Fields updated during sync:
- `home_score` - Current home team score
- `away_score` - Current away team score
- `is_final` - true when game completed
- `game_status` - ESPN status description (e.g., "Final", "Halftime")
- `last_updated` - Timestamp of last update

### Picks Table
Fields updated for completed games:
- `is_correct` - true if picked team won, false if lost

## 🐛 Known Limitations

1. **Page Refresh Required**
   - Currently refreshes entire page after updates
   - Could be optimized to update data without full refresh
   - Trade-off: Ensures all components get fresh data

2. **2-Minute Polling**
   - Fixed interval regardless of game situation
   - Could be optimized to poll more frequently during critical moments
   - Trade-off: Reduces API calls and server load

3. **ESPN API Dependency**
   - Relies on ESPN's public API availability
   - No fallback if ESPN API is down
   - Could add SportsData.io as backup (already have key)
