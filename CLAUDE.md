**Version**: 2.2.0
**Purpose**: This document serves as persistent memory for Claude Code across sessions

## üéØ Project Overview

   - Proper autoComplete and autoCapitalize per field
   - No spell check on technical fields

5. **Admin Dashboard Enhancements**
   - Payment tracking (mark paid/unpaid)
   - Life adjustments with audit trail
   - Commissioner assignment system
   - League messaging for rules/announcements

## üìä Current State

### Database Schema Key Points
```sql
-- Important tables and fields
users: id, username, display_name, email, phone_number, pin_hash
leagues: id, name, slug, invite_code, buy_in_amount, commissioner_id, picks_revealed_weeks[]
league_members: league_id, user_id, lives_remaining (default: 2), is_paid, is_eliminated
picks: user_id, league_id, game_id, team_id, week, is_correct
games: season_year, week, home_team_id, away_team_id, home_score, away_score
```

### Authentication Status
- **Current**: Simplified username + 4-digit PIN using localStorage
- **TODO**: Migrate to proper Supabase Auth with JWT tokens
- **Risk**: Sessions don't persist across devices

### Tech Stack
- **Frontend**: Next.js 15.5.2 with App Router
- **Database**: Supabase (PostgreSQL with RLS)
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS + shadcn/ui
- **Deployment**: Vercel
- **APIs**: ESPN (odds), SportsData.io (scores)

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Critical Information

### Super Admin Users (Hardcoded)
```typescript
const superAdminUsernames = ['admin', 'tgauss', 'pickemking']
```

### Environment Variables Required
```env
NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL=https://cggoycedsybrajvdqjjk.supabase.co
NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=[your_key]
SPORTSDATA_API_KEY=[your_key]
POSTMARK_API_TOKEN=[your_postmark_server_token]
```

### Known Issues to Remember
1. **Node.js 18 deprecation warnings** - Need to upgrade to v20+
2. **Build manifest errors** in development (ENOENT errors)
3. **Bundle size** - League page is 218KB (target: <150KB)
4. **No tests** - 0% coverage currently
5. **localStorage auth** - Not secure, needs migration

## üõ† Development Patterns

### Mobile Form Optimization
```typescript
// Always use these patterns for mobile inputs
<Input
  type="tel"
  inputMode="tel"        // Correct keyboard
  autoComplete="tel"     // Autofill support
  autoCapitalize="none"  // Control capitalization
  autoCorrect="off"      // No autocorrect
  spellCheck="false"     // No spell check
  className="min-h-[44px]" // Touch target
/>
```

### Commissioner Authorization
```typescript
// Pattern for checking commissioner permissions
const canRevealPicks = currentUser && league && (
  league.commissioner_id === currentUser.id || 
  ['admin', 'tgauss', 'pickemking'].includes(currentUser.username.toLowerCase())
)
```

### Database Client Creation
```typescript
// Client-side
import { createClient } from '@/lib/supabase/client'
const supabase = createClient()

// Server-side
import { createServerClient } from '@/lib/supabase/server'
const supabase = createServerClient()
```

## üìù Common Tasks & Commands

### Development
```bash
npm run dev          # Start dev server (port 3000)
npm run build        # Build for production
npm run lint         # Run ESLint
npm run typecheck    # TypeScript checking
```

### Database Migrations
```sql
-- Add new field example
ALTER TABLE users ADD COLUMN new_field TEXT;

-- Add picks revealed tracking
ALTER TABLE leagues ADD COLUMN picks_revealed_weeks integer[] DEFAULT '{}'::integer[];
```

### Testing Invite System
1. Visit: http://localhost:3000/?invite=GRID2025&inviter=taylor%20g
2. Should show: $15 buy-in, $165 pot, 11 members

## üîÑ Workflow Reminders

### When Adding New Features
1. Check KNOWN_ISSUES.md for related problems
2. Update database schema if needed
3. Ensure mobile optimization (44px targets, proper keyboards)
4. Test on actual mobile device
5. Update CHANGELOG.md
6. Commit with descriptive message

### Before Deployment
1. Run `npm run build` - ensure no TypeScript errors
2. Check bundle size hasn't increased significantly
3. Test critical user flows
4. Update version in package.json
5. Document in CHANGELOG.md

## üí° Future Session Context

### Current Status After Sept 15 Session
- **Week 1**: ‚úÖ Completed with final scores and analysis
- **Week 2**: ‚úÖ Completed with first elimination (Kevyn R)
- **Week 3**: üü¢ ACTIVE for picks (forced current after Week 2 completion)
- **Players**: 22 with 2 lives (tied 1st), 3 with 1 life (tied 23rd), 1 eliminated
- **Cemetery**: Live with Kevyn R's gravestone and RIP popup
- **Interface**: Enhanced with Cemetery, tied standings, Week 2 recap audio

### Priority Tasks
1. **Week-by-week maintenance** - Monitor score syncing and pick processing
2. **Upgrade to Node.js 20+** - Critical for Supabase compatibility (warnings appearing)
3. **Implement proper auth** - Replace localStorage with Supabase Auth
4. **Add email notifications** - Pick reminders, elimination alerts
5. **Write tests** - Currently 0% coverage
6. **Optimize bundle** - Reduce from 268KB to <150KB (increased slightly)

### Code Cleanup Opportunities
- Remove unused `game_odds` table
- Refactor duplicate Supabase client creation
- Extract common error handling patterns
- Lazy load admin components
- Remove TutorialWizard if unused (~15KB)

### Performance Targets
- Lighthouse Mobile: 90+ (currently ~85)
- Bundle size: <150KB (currently 218KB)
- First Contentful Paint: <1.5s
- Time to Interactive: <3s

## üêõ Quick Debug Reference

### Common Errors & Fixes
1. **"buy_in undefined"** ‚Üí Use `buy_in_amount` field
2. **"Cannot find user"** ‚Üí Check localStorage has currentUser
3. **"Picks not showing"** ‚Üí Check if week is in picks_revealed_weeks
4. **Build errors** ‚Üí Run `npm run typecheck` for details
5. **Dev server crashes** ‚Üí Kill port 3000 and restart

### Database Quick Queries
```sql
-- Check league status
SELECT * FROM leagues WHERE invite_code = 'GRID2025';

-- Count members
SELECT COUNT(*) FROM league_members WHERE league_id = '[id]';

-- Check user picks
SELECT * FROM picks WHERE user_id = '[id]' AND week = 1;
```
